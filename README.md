Two .m files.

#exp1.m

Suppose data follows norm distribution, and set a threshold to determine the scale of this dataset.

Then, set initial SNR, use sqrt(N) to derive a final noise-mitigated result.

Plot Results and some mid-results.

Error=BiasOfModel+BiasOfDiscretization(means data are not sampled in the training set)+Noise(or Variance).
#exp2.m

try to clone the curves of Google(Accuracy-vs-scale, Neural Network and other methods).
